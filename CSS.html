# What is CSS
  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature of HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL
  CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most website to create user interfaces for web applicarions and user interfaces for many mobile applications

# What are the advantages of CSS 
  i. CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML page. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want
  ii. Easy maintenance: To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically
  iii. Global web standards: Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers
  iv. Platform Independence: The script offer consistent platform independence and can support latest browser as well

# Disadvantages of Cascading Style Sheets
  i. Come in different leves: There's CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, which has resulted in confusion among developers and web browsers. One type of CSS should be enough. It would be preferable than having to choose which CSS levl to use 
  ii. Fragmentation: With CSS, what works with one browser may not always work with another. This is why web developers have to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers before a website is set 
  iii. Lack of security: Because it is an open-based system CSS doesn't have the built-in security that will protect it from being overridden. Anyone who has a read/write access to a website can change the CSS file
