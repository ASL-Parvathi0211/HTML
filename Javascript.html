Introduction to JavaScript 
Objects in Javascript: Data and objects in Java Script, Regular Expressions, Exception Handling

What is DHTML?
--> DHTML stands for dynamic HTML 
--> DHTML is not a language that describing of making dynamic and interactive web pages
--> Dynamic means the ability of the browser to alter a web document and style after the document has loaded
--> DHTML gives you more control than the HTML elements
--> DHTML is basically a combination of HTML, CSS & Javascript 
--> DHTML is a new tool for web designers to create web pages with special effects and animations 
--> DHTML makes the faster and more interactive for end users. Updates can be activated by user and browser-driven events 

A browser-driven event can be triggered by internal actions, such as when the browser finishes downloading the webpage
Components of DHTML: DHTML requires 4-independent components to work
1. HTML: 
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Languge and it is the most widely used language to design web pages. HTML defines the structure of a web page, using some basic elements or tags
    <html>
        <head>
            <title> ---- </title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1> --- </h1><br>
            <h2> --- </h2><br>
            <p> ---- </p>
            <ol>
                <li> --- </li>
                <li> --- </li>
                <li> --- </li>
            </ol>
        </body>
    </html>

2. CSS:
    Cascading Style Sheet contrls the formatting of HTML elements. It defines how to display HTML elements over a web page CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document 
    Example: <html>
                <head>
                    <style type = "text/css">
                    <!--
                    body
                    {
                        background:red;
                        font-family:verdana;
                    }
                    h1, h2
                    {
                        font:Bold;
                        font-size:24pt;
                        color:blue;
                    }
                    -->
                    </style>
                    <title> Cascading Style Sheet </title>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <h1> Welcome to the world of style sheet </h1>
                    <h2> This heading is also displays as defined style Rules </h2>
                    </body>
             </html>

3. Javascript:
    Scripting provides the mechanisms to interpret user actions and produce client-side changes to a page. For example scripts can interpret mouse actions and respond to the action by using a set of pre-defined instructions
    Althrough DHTML can communicate with several scripting languages 
    Example: <! Javascript Example>
            <html>
                <head>
                    <title> Javascript Programming </title>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <h1><center> Address </center></h1>
                    <script language = "Javascript" type = "Text/Javascript">
                        document.write("ASLParvathi");
                        document.write("Lubbock<br>");
                        document.write("Texas<br>")
                        document.write("United States<br>");
                        document.write("PIN");
                    </script>
                </body>
            </html>

4. DOM:
    Document Object Model outlines web page content in a way that makes it possible for HTML elements, style sheets and scripting languages to interact with each other 
    DOM is a platform and language neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of document 

Explain benefits of Javascript?
--> Javascript is the most popular scripting language. It was developed by Netscape and sun-micro systems in 1995
--> Javascript is derived from Java but it is not the same thing as Java. Java is a pure object-oriented, high-level programming language 
--> Javascript is a light weight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities 
--> Javascript allows you to build interactivity into static html pages. Javascript code can be executed by all modern web browsers
--> Javascript code is typically embedded in the HTML document to be interpreted and run by the client's browser

Features of Javascript
--> Javascript is an object-based scripting language
--> It is the default scripting language for most of web browsers
--> It offers cross platform support for most web browsers
--> Giving the user more control over the browser 
--> It is used for only client-side applications
--> It handling date and time values
--> It is light weighted 
--> Javascript is case-sensitive 
--> Javascript has the ability to create new functions within scripts 

Benefits of Javascript 
1. Less server interaction: Through Javascript, you can validate user input on the client-side before sending the page to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on server 
2. Increased Interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the user covers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard
3. easy to learn: Javascript language is relatively easy to learn and comprises of syntax that is close to english
4. Speed: Being client side, Javascript is very fast because any code or functions can be run immediately on the client side instead of having to contact the server and wait for an response
5. Versatility: Javascript plays with other languages and can be used in a huge variety of applications. Javascript can also be used inside scripts written in other languages such as PERL and PHP
