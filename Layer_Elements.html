What is Layer Element in HTML? Explain with suitable examples?
  The HTML <layer> tag is used to position and animate elements in a page. A layer can be thought of as a seperate document that resides on top of the main one, all existing within one window 

  Example: The example creates three overlapping layers. The back one is res, the middle one is blue, and the front one is green 
           <html>
            <head>
                <title> HTML layer Tag </title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <layer id = "layer1" top = "250" left = "50" width = "200" height = "200" bgcolor = "red">
                    <p> layer1 </p>
                </layer>
                <layer id = "layer2" top = "350" left = "150" width = "200" height = "200" bgcolor = "blue">
                    <p> layer2 </p>
                </layer>
                <layer id = "layer3" top = "450" left = "250" width = "200" height = "200" bgcolor = "green">
                    <p> layer3 </p>
                </layer>
            </body>
           </html>
    
    CSS gives you opportunity to create layers of various divisions. The CSS layers refer to applying the z-index property to elements that overlap with each other
    The z-index property is used along with the position property to create an effect of layers. You can specify which elements should come on top and which element should come at bottom.
    A z-index property can help you to create more complex webpage layouts. 

    Example to create layers in CSS
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div style = "background-color: red; 
            width:300px; 
            height:100px; 
            position:relative; 
            top:10px; 
            left:80px; 
            z-index:2">
            </div>

            <div style = "background-color:yellow;
            width:300px;
            height:100px;
            position:relative;
            top:60px;
            left:35px;
            z-index:1;">
            </div>

            <div style = "background-color:green;
            width:300px;
            height:100px;
            position:realtive;
            top:220px;
            left:120px;
            z-index:3;">
            </div>
        </body>
    </html>
