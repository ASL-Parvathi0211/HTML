Messages & Confirmations 
  Javascript provides some inbuilt methods or function which are used to give specific kind of messages and confirmations to the users. Confirmations are most often used to confirm important that are taking place on a website
    1. alert() 
      The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an ok button. The alert box takes the focus away from the current window, and forces the web browser to read the message 
      It prevents the user from accessing other parts of the web page wntil the laert box is closed.It is mostly used to give a warning message to the users. 
      For example, if one input field requires entering some text but the user does not provide any input, then as a part fo a validation, you can use alert box to give a warning message 

      Example: <html>
                 <head>
                    <title> alert function </title>
                 </head>
                 <body>
                    <script type = "text/Javascript">
                        function warn()
                        {
                            alert("This is a warning message");
                        }
                        <h3> click the following button to see the result </h3>
                        <form>
                            <input type = "button" value = "click me" onclick = "warn">
                        </form>
                    </script>
                 </body>
               </html>

    2. confirm()
      The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with an ok and cancel buttons. A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something. The confirm box takes the focus away from the current window, and forces the web browser to read the message. It also prevent the user from accessing other parts of the web page until the box is closed. The confirm() method returns True if the user clicked ok and false otherwise.
