Moving Images 
  Javascript can be used to move an image around the webpage according to some sort of pattern determined by a logical equation or function. Moving images around the screen is simple. In fact that is not a moving image at all, that's just the effect. What is actually moving is a layer of content. 
  To make an animation possible, the animated element must be animated relative to a parent container
  The container element should be created with style = "position:relative"
  The animation element should be created with style = "position:absolute"
  Using DOM object properties and Javascript function we can move the images/objects. 
    1. we are using the javascript function getelementsbyID()  to get a dom object and then assigning it to a global variable imgobj
    2. we have defined an initiliazation function init() to initialize imgobj, where we have set its position and left attributes
    3. we are calling initialization function at the time of window load
    4. finally, we are calling moveRight() function to increase the left distance by 10pixels. You could also set it to a negative value to move it to the left side

    EX: moving images
        <html>
          <title> Javascript Animation </title>
          <script type = "text/javascript">
            var imgobj = null;
            function init()
            {
              imgobj = document.getelementByID('myImage');
              imgobj.style.position = 'relative'
              imgobj.style.left = 'opx';
            }
            function moveRight()
            {
              imgobj.style.left = parseInt(imgobj.style.left)+10+'px';
            }
          </script>
          <body>
            <form>
              <img id = 'myImage' src = "D:\move\button_red.gif"\>
              <p> click button below to move the image to right</p>
              <input type = "button" value = "clickme" onclick = "moveRight();"\>
            </form>
          </body>
        </html>
