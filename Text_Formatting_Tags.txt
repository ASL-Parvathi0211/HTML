# Various Text Formatting Tags in HTML 
  Heading Styles: HTML supports six different levels of headings. The highest-level header format is <h1> and the lowest level is <h6>. All the styles appear in BOLD face and the size of the heading depends on the level chosen <h1> to <h6>
    Example:
      <h1> Texas Tech University </h1>
      <h2> Texas Tech University </h2>
      <h3> Texas Tech University </h3>
      <h4> Texas Tech University </h4>
      <h5> Texas Tech University </h5>
      <h6> Texas Tech University </h6>

  Bold Text: <b> tag is used to set the text as bold </b>
    Example:
      <b> Texas Tech University </b>
    *The <b> tag still works, but <strong> is now the preferred choice for marking bold text with semantic meaning. <strong> indicates that the text is of strong importance, and it is usually rendered bold by default.
        <strong> Texas Tech university </strong>

  Italic Text: <i> tag is used to set the text as italic </i>
    Example:
      <i> Texas Tech University </i>

  Underlining Text: <u> tag is used to set the text as underlining </u>
    Example: 
      <u> Texas Tech University </u>

  Striking Text: <s> and <strike> tags are used to set the text as striking
    Example: 
      <strike> Texas Tech University </strike>

  Bigger text: <big> tag is used to set the text as bigger </big>
    Example:
      <big> Texas Tech University </big>

  Smaller text: <small> tag is used to set the text as smaller </small>
    Example: 
      <small> Texas Tech University </small>
    *The <big> and <small> tags still work, but they are deprecated. It's better to use CSS to adjust the text size

  Subscript Text: <sub> tag is used to set the text as subscript </sub>
    Example: 
      H<sub>2</sub>0
 
  Superscript Text: <sup> tag is used to set the text as superscript </sup>
    Example:
      (A+B)<sup>2</sup>=A<sup>2</sup>+B<sup>2</sup>+2AB
    * Both <sub> and <sup> remain in use and are appropriate for their intended purposes, like writing chemical formulas or mathematical equations.

  Strong Text: <strong> tag is used to set the text as strong bold </strong>
    Example: 
      <strong> Texas Tech University </strong>
    
  Font Tag: <font> tag is used to display the text in various sizes, various colors and various styles
    Example: 
      <FONT FACE = "Arial" SIZE = "4" COLOR = "RED"> Nagarjuna </FONT>
      <FONT FACE = "Calibri" SIZE = "5" COLOR = "Green"> Nagarjuna </FONT>
      <FONT FACE = "Chiller" SIZE = "6" COLOR = "Blue"> Nagarjuna </FONT>
    * The <font> tag is deprecated in HTML5. The recommended approach is to use CSS for styling fonts, including size, color, and typeface.

  Blinking Text: <Blink> tag is used to set the text as blinking </Blink>
    Example: 
      <Blink> Texas Tech University </Blink>
    * The <blink> tag is obsolete and should be avoided. Blinking text is now considered distracting and is not supported in modern browsers. You should use CSS animations or JavaScript if you want to achieve similar effects

  Deleted Text: <DEL> tag is used to set the text as deleted text </DEL>
    Example:
      <DEL> Deleted Text </DEL>

  Alignement Tags: These tags are used for presenting and arranging text

  Paragraph Text: <p> tag is used to arrange the text intro paragraphs. It contain one attribute that is align = "center/left/right"
    Example: 
      <p align = "left/center/right">
           ---text
      </p>

  Line breaks: <br> tag is used to move the text to next line
    Example: 
      SRINIVASARAO <br> Lubbock <br> Texas

  Centering Text: <center> tag is used to align the text/image at center of webpage
    Example:
      <center> Texas Tech University </center>
    
  Performatted Text: <pre> tag is used to set the text with pre formatted structure it means it automatically arranges the text in proper alignment </pre>
    Example:
      <pre>
              *
             * *
            * * *
           * * * *
          * * * * * 
      </pre>

  Horizontal Rules: <hr> tag is used to draw the line in various sizes. It contains five attributes size, width, color and align and noshade
    Example: 
      <HR align = "Center" size = "5" width = "75%" color = "green" noshade>

  Block of Text Formatting: <div> tag is used to divide the page content into no.of blocks. We can apply different formats to different blocks. </div>
    Syntax:
      <div name = "div_name" align = "top/bottom/center" style = "style-attributes" > 
        -- text 
      </div>
    Example:
      <div style = "left:50px; top:250px; position:absolute; color:red; text:white; font-size:36pt; border:thin-groove;">
        <p> This is the higher layer </p>
      </div>

        white-space: nowrap;
        overflow: hidden;
        box-sizing: border-box;
        animation: scroll 5s linear infinite;
       }
       @keyframes scroll {
        from { text-indent: 100%; }
        to { text-indent: -100%; }
      }
      </style>

  LOOP: Sets how many times you want the marquee to cycle
    Example: 
      <marquee align = "middle" direction = "right" behaviour = "alternate" scrollamount = 100 bgcolor = "blue" loop = 4 width = "75%" height = "15%">
        Texas Tech University
      </marquee>

  Creating Columns: <multicol> tag is used to break the text into number of columns. This tag supports in Netscape Navigator browser
    Example:
      <multicol cols = 3 width = "90%" gutter = 10>
        The browser displays the hyper link text in a blue color and also displays the text with underlined. When the mouse cursor is placed over it, the mouse cursor changes to the shape of hand.
      </multicol>
    * This was a Netscape-only tag and never became part of standard HTML. It's obsolete.
