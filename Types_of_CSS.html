# What is CSS? Explain types of CSS with examples?
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide easy and effective alternatives to specify various attributes for the HTML tags. Using CSS you can specify a number of style properties for a given HTML element. Each property has a name and a value, seperated by a colon(:). Each property declaration is seperated by a semi-colon(;)

CSS are 3 types
1. Inline Style Sheet: Define style sheet rules directly along-with the HTML elements using style attribute 
    You can apply style sheet rules directly to any HTML element using style attribute of the relevant tag. This should be done only when you are interested to make a particular change in any HTML element only 
    Rules defined inline with the element overrides the rules defined in an external CSS file as well as the rules defined in element <style></style>

    Example: <html>
        <head>
            <title> HTML Inline CSS </title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p style = "color:red;"> This is red </p>
            <p style = "font-size:20px;"> This is thick </p>
            <p style = "color:green;"> This is green </p>
            <p style = "color:green;" font-size:20px;> This is thick and green </p>
        </body>
    </html>

2. Internal Style Sheet: Define style sheet rules in header section of the HTML document using <style></style> tag
    If you want to apply style sheet rules to s single document only, then you can include those rules in header section of the HTML document using <style></style> tag
    Rules defined in internal style sheet overrides the rules defined in an external CSS files

    Example: <html>
        <head>
            <title> HTML Internal CSS </title>
            <style type = "text/css">
                .red{
                    color:red;
                }
                .thick 
                {
                    font-size:20px;
                }
                .green{
                    color:green;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p class = "red"> This is red Color Information </p>
            <p class = "thick"> This is thick color inforamtion </p>
            <p class = "green"> This is green color information </p>
            <p class = "thick green"> This is thick and green color information </p>
        </body>
    </html>

3. External Style Sheet: Define style sheet rules in a separate .css file and then include that file in your HTML <link> tag
    If you need to use your style sheet to various pages, then its always recommended to define a common style sheet in a separate file. A cascading style sheet file will have extension as .css and it will be included in HTML files using <link> tag
    Consider we define a style sheet file style.css which has following rules

    .red{
        color:red;
    }
    .thick{
        font-size:20px;
    }
    .green{
        color:green;
    }
    Here we defined three CSS rules which will be applicable to three different classes defined for the HTML tags. I suggest you should not bother about how these rules are being defined beacuse you can learn them while studying CSS. 

<html>
    <head>
        <title> HTML External CSS </title>
        <link re1 = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "html/style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <p class = "red"> This is red </p>
        <p class = "thick"> This is thick </p>
        <p class = "green"> This is green </p>
        <p class = "thick green"> This is thick and green </p>
    </body>
</html>
